### The Radio ###

The radio layout has been inspired heavily by the **[Raspberry Pi radio player with touchscreen](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-radio-player-with-touchscreen/overview)** by [Spencer Organ](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/Uktechreviews) from the [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Uses icons from the [Material design icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/) by Google, Inc

### Alarm ###

Uses [Material](https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/tree/master/data/sounds/alarms/material/ogg) alarm sounds from the [`platforms_frameworks_base`](https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base) repository by [The Android Open Source Project](http://source.android.com/)
